        <span className="author">MICHAEL H. SCHECTER</span> is an optimistic,
        extroverted, happygo-lucky guy who enjoys the little things in life.
        Born and raised in Rome, Georgia, he now lives in Charlotte, North
        Carolina, with his wife Caline, dog Mowgli, and two cats Jaxon and
        Brynn. In his free time, Michael is often found playing video games with
        friends, tennis with his wife, or playing the piano. Michael works as a
        neurologist and is also the son of aneurologist. As such, he has an
        intimate understanding of the importance of brain health, and what
        better way to exercise the mind than with brain games like riddles!
        Realizing he had a knack for making them, Michael now thoroughly enjoys
        watching friends and family solve them.
